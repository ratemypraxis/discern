The process included digital volunteers from around the world cross-checking google maps feeds of intersections throughout the city to identify and label cameras. The project ended in 2021 but some images from google maps may have been from years earlier. This dataset is not meant to be a foolproof map of exact camera locations but a rough estimate with a messiness that perhaps asks for further questioning of why this information is otherwise unreported by both public and private camera maintainers. No user data, including location, is recorded or stored.')">Disclaimer</button>

The implementation of digital and automated policing technologies such as video surveillance cameras, facial recognition searching, AI gunshot detection microphones and automated license plate readers (to name just a few) only complicate this legacy of inequity in the application of carceral power and judicial exception to which these communities are subjected to. While no single act or tool can undo the years and years of harm that these practices (which can be traced back to this country\'s period of enslavement and colonization) can immediately unravel the infrastructure that supports them, discernible.tech aims to at least contribute to a growing public consciousness on these systems and calls for support to reject and/or better regulate them in the public interest.')">Context</button>
